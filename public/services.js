//       'Dental sealant is a thin, plastic coating painted on the chewing surfaces of teeth -- usually the back teeth (the premolars and molars) -- to prevent tooth decay. The sealant quickly bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth, forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth.Although thorough brushing and flossing can remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth, they cannot always get into all the nooks and crannies of the back teeth to remove the food and plaque. Sealants protect these vulnerable areas from tooth decay by "sealing out" plaque and food.Who Should Get SealantsBecause of the likelihood of developing decay in the depressions and grooves of the premolars and molars, children and teenagers are candidates for sealants. However, adults without decay or fillings in their molars can also benefit from sealants.',

//       "Can Anyone Get Dental Implants. In most cases, anyone healthy enough to undergo a routine dental extraction or oral surgery can be considered for a dental implant. Patients should have healthy gums and enough bone to hold the implant. They also must be committed to good oral hygiene and regular dental visits. Heavy smokers, people suffering from uncontrolled chronic disorders -- such as diabetes or heart disease -- or patients who have had radiation therapy to the head/neck area need to be evaluated on an individual basis. If you are considering implants, talk to your dentist to see if they are right for you.Does Insurance Cover the Cost of Dental Implants.In general, dental implants are not covered by dental insurance at this time. Coverage under your medical plan may be possible, depending on the insurance plan and/or cause of tooth loss. Detailed questions about your individual needs and how they relate to insurance should be discussed with your dentist and insurance provider.",

If your wisdom teeth are impacted, for example, removing them may require you see an oral surgeon. If you suffer from gum disease and have to have a gum graft, you’d be referred to a periodontist who performs those types of oral surgeries.you require oral surgery, your general dentist will talk to you about it and refer you to the right provider.How do I prepare for oral surgery?Prepare for an oral surgery in the same way you would for any serious medical procedure, depending on the type of surgery. And always make sure to follow your dentist’s direction.Your oral surgery recovery is of critical importance to the outcomes you and your dentists have discussed. Don’t smoke or drink alcohol afterward—they can slow your healing process. If you’re in any pain from swelling, use an ice pack to reduce inflammation. Rather than brushing your teeth, rinse your mouth with salt water every few hours to kill off any bacteria.",
